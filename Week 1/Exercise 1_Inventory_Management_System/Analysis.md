# Inventory Management System - Analysis

## Time Complexity Analysis

### Add Product
- **Operation**: Adding a product to the inventory.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) (average case)
- **Explanation**: In a `HashMap`, the `put` method has an average time complexity of O(1) because it computes the hash code of the key and places the value in the appropriate bucket. However, in the worst-case scenario, where there are many hash collisions, the time complexity could degrade to O(n), where n is the number of entries in the map.

### Update Product
- **Operation**: Updating an existing product in the inventory.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) (average case)
- **Explanation**: Updating a product in a `HashMap` is similar to adding a product. The `put` method will overwrite the existing value if the key already exists, and this operation has an average time complexity of O(1). As with adding a product, the worst-case scenario time complexity is O(n).

### Delete Product
- **Operation**: Deleting a product from the inventory.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) (average case)
- **Explanation**: Deleting a product in a `HashMap` uses the `remove` method, which also has an average time complexity of O(1) as it relies on finding the bucket for the key and removing the entry. Again, the worst-case scenario is O(n) due to potential hash collisions.

### Get Product
- **Operation**: Retrieving a product from the inventory.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) (average case)
- **Explanation**: Retrieving a product uses the `get` method of the `HashMap`, which has an average time complexity of O(1) because it quickly finds the bucket associated with the key. The worst-case scenario, due to hash collisions, is O(n).

### Display Inventory
- **Operation**: Displaying all products in the inventory.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Explanation**: Displaying all products involves iterating over the values in the `HashMap`, which requires O(n) time, where n is the number of products in the inventory.

## Optimization Strategies

1. **Reduce Hash Collisions**
   - Use a good hash function to evenly distribute keys.
2. **Monitor Load Factor and Rehash**
   - Resize the hash table when necessary to maintain O(1) operations.
3. **Batch Processing**
   - Implement batch updates and deletions to reduce overhead.
4. **Cache Frequently Accessed Products**
   - Improve read performance by caching commonly used products.
